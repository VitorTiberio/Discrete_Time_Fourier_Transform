# Discrete Time Fourier Transfomr - DTFT # 

To initialize our analysis, we need to define a intermediary function, to help us to get the DTFT. 

When we are talking about g[n], the value in intervals of n is equal to zero, while the value in n is different zero. 

So, to define this function, we are going to use a fabulous function: the delta/ impulse function! Suppose we have a impulse funciton like this: 

$\delta(t - nT_s)$
